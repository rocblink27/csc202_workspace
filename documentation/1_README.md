## Introduction
Welcome to CSC-202: Programming Embedded Microcontrollers in C and Assembly at Monroe Community College! This repository contains the necessary files to set up the workspace for Code Composer Studio - Theia (CCS-Theia), a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you'll use throughout this course. These files serve as the foundation for your development environment, allowing you to dive into embedded systems programming using both C and Assembly.

This workspace allows you to build, debug, and test embedded microcontroller projects quickly. It provides the tools, libraries, and setup to help you get started quickly and stay organized.

## Hardware
This workspace is developed specifically for the following hardware:

- Texas Instrument's MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad (LP-MSPM0G3507)
- MCC's CSC202 Expansion Board
- LCD1602 Module
- 4x4 Matrix keypad

The LaunchPad and CSC202 Expansion Board are essential for the course's embedded systems development exercises. They provide a hardware platform for interacting with the microcontroller and facilitating input/output operations.
