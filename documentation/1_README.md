## Introduction
Welcome to CSC-202: Programming Embedded Microcontrollers in C and Assembly at Monroe Community College! This repository contains the necessary files to set up the workspace for Code Composer Studio - Theia (CCS-Theia), a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you'll use throughout this course. These files serve as the foundation for your development environment, allowing you to dive into embedded systems programming using both C and Assembly.

This workspace allows you to build, debug, and test embedded microcontroller projects quickly. It provides the tools, libraries, and setup to help you get started quickly and stay organized.

## Hardware
This workspace is developed specifically for the following hardware:

- Texas Instrument's MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad (LP-MSPM0G3507)
- MCC's CSC202 Expansion Board
- LCD1602 Module
- 4x4 Matrix keypad

The LaunchPad and CSC202 Expansion Board are essential for the course's embedded systems development exercises. They provide a hardware platform for interacting with the microcontroller and facilitating input/output operations.

## Setting up Project for CSC202 Lab Assignments

This workspace contains a default project called **"Default_project"**. This project contains essential support files and code written specifically for the CSC202 course and should **not** be edited directly. Instead, you should create a **copy** of this project to avoid making changes to the original files.

### Steps to Duplicate the Project and Rename It

1. **Duplicate the Default Project:**
   - Right-click on the **"Default_project"** in your CCS-Theia workspace.
   - Select **"Duplicate"** from the context menu.
   - This will create a copy of the project, leaving the original untouched.

2. **Rename the Project:**
   - After duplicating the project, right-click on the new copy and select **"Rename"**.
   - Rename the project to an appropriate name for your lab. For example, if you're working on **Lab 2**, rename the project to **"Lab2"**.
   
3. **Rename the main.c File:**
   - In your newly duplicated project, find the **main.c** file.
   - Right-click on **main.c** and select **"Rename"**.
   - Rename the file to **lab2_main.c** (or a similar name corresponding to your project).
   
### Why Rename the Project and main.c?

- **Avoid Confusion**: When working on multiple projects or labs, having **unique names** for each project and **main.c** file ensures that you don't accidentally edit the wrong file or project.
- **Better Organization**: Renaming the file helps keep your workspace organized, especially as you move through different labs or assignments.
